## About Me
I am Qi Zhang (张启)， an associate professor in statistics in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at University of New Hampshire (UNH).
Here are my [UNH page](https://ceps.unh.edu/person/qi-zhang), [GitHub](https://github.com/QiZhangStat), and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Qi-Zhang-162)
 

## Research Interests
You can find my almost complete list of academic publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=-dByskMAAAAJ)

My research areas include high dimensional data analysis, causal inference, machine learning in general. My current research interests include high dimensional mediation, heterogeneous treatment effect estimation, high dimensional variable selection, and deep generative models. I am interested in statistical applications in multi-omics, medical records, and materials research. 

Will fill in more details when I have a chance.
